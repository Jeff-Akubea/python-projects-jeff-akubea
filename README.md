# python-projects-jeff-akubea
"A collection of Python games and programs I built, including Rock Paper Scissors, Number Guessing Game, and Login System."

This repository contains three beginner-friendly Python projects I developed as part of my learning journey.  
Each project demonstrates different programming concepts, such as loops, conditionals, user input, and error handling.
